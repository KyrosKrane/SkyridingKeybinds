# Skyriding Keybinds
A World of Warcraft addon to enable mouse buttons for skyriding (aka dragon riding)

This is a very simple addon that binds the three main skyriding abilities to your mouse, but only when you're flying on a skyriding mount. When you stop flying or dismount, the buttons go back to the original binds that you have set.

* Button 3 (center mouse button or wheel): Whirling Surge
* Button 4 (back button by your thumb): Skyward Ascent
* Button 5 (front button by your thumb): Surge Forward

There's no setup or configuration, just install and go!
